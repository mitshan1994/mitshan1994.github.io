This includes some notes about C/C++ on Linux.

### Show Compiler Including Path
```
# c
echo | gcc -E -Wp,-v -

# cpp
echo | cpp -xc++ -Wp,-v
```

### Show Linker Searching Path
```
gcc -print-search-dirs | sed '/^lib/b 1;d;:1;s,/[^/.][^/]*/\.\./,/,;t 1;s,:[^=]*=,:;,;s,;,;  ,g' | tr \; \\012 | tr : \\012
```

I didn't find any C++ version, so maybe it's same under C and C++.
